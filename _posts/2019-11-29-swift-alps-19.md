# Swift Alps 2019

This post contains the starting resources, documentation, and links for the workshops run by Mars and Paris at <a href="https://theswiftalps.com">Swift Alps 2019</a>.

## Workshop 1: Practical AI with Swift

Learn to use CreateML and CoreML, Apple's Swift-powered machine learning (ML) frameworks. You can build everything from an image classifier, to an app that can generate images, to a style transfer app to mimic famous art styles. It's easier than it sounds, and it's a great place to get started in the world of AI and ML.

### Prerequisites

* a recent version of Xcode 11
* macOS Catalina

## Workshop 2: Swift for TensorFlow

Take your knowledge of Swift in an entirely new direction with Swift for TensorFlow, Google's brand new machine learning framework, built on Swift, and created by Chris Lattner, the original creator of Swift. Swift for TensorFlow is a proper, powerful, scientific and numerical computing framework built from the ground up to take advantage of everything Swift and LLVM (Swift's underlying compiler framework) can do. Learn how to build a neural network from scratch, how to train it, and how the ins-and-outs of machine learning work at a lower level than Apple's frameworks. And do it all with Swift.

### Prerequisites

* a Google Account capable of accessing both Google Drive and Google Colab
* an internet connection

### Resources

* to create a blank Swift Notebook in Google Colab visit this URL: <a href="http://lab.to/s4tf_blank">http://lab.to/s4tf_blank</a>

### Getting Started

### To copy the tutorial notebooks into your Google Drive:

1. Open the shared Google Drive folder, containing the notebooks:
     * [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MBVimepXYoiNOB3-L4mATk8Msz9ISigE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MBVimepXYoiNOB3-L4mATk8Msz9ISigE)

2. Add the shared `SwiftAlps19_S4TF` folder to _your_ Google Drive:
    * Click the dropdown next to the folders name, and then clicking "Add to My Drive", as shown in the image below.

3. Once the `SwiftAlps19_S4TF` folder is in _your_ Google Drive:
   
    - Open whichever notebook(s) you want to work with by double clicking them, and then clicking Google Colaboratory, as shown in the image below.

    - If you see the notebook as raw text, click the "Open with" dropdown at the top, and click Google Colaboratory, or if you don't see Colab as an option, click "Connect more apps":

4. Once your notebook is open, run it in Playground mode to allow cells to compile and run, as shown in the image below.
