We've gone a bit radio silent on this website for a few reasons: we've been speaking at lots of conferences, and we've been finishing the book! We've finally submitted the complete manuscript to production, and while it may have our very temporary cover (pictured above) attached, it will soon be available in Early Release via O'Reilly's Learning Platform. Later in the year, around October (we hope!) it will be available broadly, via Amazon and other reputable book sellers. We're incredibly excited to have finished the book, and we're going to be spending the next few weeks keeping the final manuscript up to date with any changes Apple makes to their platforms during the final round of iOS and macOS betas, as well as for the latest versions of the Swift programming language.

We'll be posting more updates soon! Stay tuned.
