As we form this site--excited about the opportunity to enthuse about and share our knowledge of Swift and AI in general--we are spooling up for a week of presenting at one of our favourite conferences, [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or). In it's 20th year in 2018, and back in the Portland we love, we are pleased to be speaking about games, AI and Swift in the same week.

This first talk, presented by Paris, Tim and I, will be presented on the last day of the conference. It will cover the basics and beauty of the Swift Language, as well as our love of Playgrounds, through a live-coding demo. To enhance the experience **we have made available the take-home files**--as well as the talk file once completed--on [GitHub](https://github.com/thesecretlab/LearningSwiftAtOSCON2018).

I am especially enthused about Playgrounds at the moment, given I was recently awarded a scholarship to WWDC for [my Playgrounds submission on Procedural Terrain Generation](https://github.com/TheMartianLife/WWDC-2018) and got to see a bunch of great content on Playgrounds, Playgrounds Books and Playgrounds subscriptions--on top of how much I and my fellow presenters use it to work through stuff in our daily lives.

If you are in attendance, please [join us](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/67645).
