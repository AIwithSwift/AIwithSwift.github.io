As we form this site--excited about the opportunity to enthuse about and share our knowledge of Swift and AI in general--we are spooling up for a week of presenting at one of our favourite conferences, [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or). In it's 20th year in 2018, and back in the Portland we love, we are pleased to be speaking about games, AI and Swift in the same week.

This first talk, presented by Paris, Tim and Mars, will be presented on the last day of the conference. It will cover the basics and beauty of the Swift Language, as well as our love of Playgrounds, through live-coding demo. To enhance the experience **we have made available the take-home files**--as well as the talk file once completed--on [GitHub](https://github.com/thesecretlab/LearningSwiftAtOSCON2018).
