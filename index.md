"*Artificial intelligence and… Swift?! Don’t you mean Python?*" No, we mean Swift. Here’s why.

Swift was designed to create and a powerful, simple, easy to learn language that incorporated best-practices from academia and industry into one multi-paradigm, safe, interoperable language that is suitable for anything from low-level programming to high-level scripting. It succeeded, to varying degrees.

Swift is an in demand, fast growing, popular language, with estimates of more than a million programmers currently using it. The community is diverse and vibrant, and the tooling is mature. Swift is dominant in development Apple’s iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, but is gaining ground on the server and in the cloud.

Swift has many great attributes, and reasons that it’s a great choice for learning development, and development of all kinds, with a design that focuses on performance, safety, native deployment, clarity and rapid evolution. Let's take this powerful invention and apply it to the growing area of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, in ways that can be done by virtually anyone.
